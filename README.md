This repo provides an interactive introduction to the OPERA Disturbance (DIST) product. The OPERA DIST product maps per pixel vegetation disturbance (specifically, vegetation cover loss) from the Harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 A/B (HLS) images. More information about OPERA DIST is provided at https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/dist-product-suite.

The repo contains two Jupyter notebooks that give an introduction of the DIST product suite (Intro_To_Dist.ipynb) and allow you to visualize and interact with a provisional DIST product that tracks the evolution of an active wildfire that started on 29 July 2022 in McKinney, California, USA (McKinney.ipynb). To get started click the Binder logo above. Binder will open the Jupyter notebooks in an executable environment without requiring you to install any new software.
