This repo provides an interactive introduction to the OPERA Disturbance (DIST) product. The OPERA DIST product maps per pixel vegetation disturbance (specifically, vegetation cover loss) from the Harmonized Landsat-8 Sentinel-2 A/B (HLS) images. More information about OPERA DIST is available at https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/dist-product-suite.

This repo contains two Jupyter notebooks that 1) give an introduction of the DIST product suite (Intro_To_Dist.ipynb) and 2) visualize a provisional DIST product that tracks the evolution of an active wildfire that started on 29 July 2022 in McKinney, California, USA (McKinney.ipynb). To get started click the launch Binder logo above. Binder will open the Jupyter notebooks in an executable environment without requiring you to install any new software.
